# Koopman-based KSVD

This repository contains the implementation of the Koopman-based Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) method, a novel approach designed to analyze dynamic systems by leveraging the properties of the Koopman operator and KSVD.

## Introduction

Koopman-based KSVD is an innovative framework that integrates the KSVD algorithm with Koopman operator theory to provide a powerful tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. This method is particularly useful for extracting detailed features and dynamics that traditional methods may overlook.

## Features

- **Koopman Operator Analysis:** Leverage the Koopman operator's ability to linearly represent nonlinear dynamics.
- **Kernel SVD Integration:** Utilize KSVD for enhanced feature extraction from dynamical systems.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently handle large datasets and complex dynamical models.
- **Flexibility:** Configurable parameters to suit various types of dynamical systems.
